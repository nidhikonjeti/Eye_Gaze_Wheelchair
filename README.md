# Eye-Gaze-Controlled-Wheelchair
The IoT-based Eye Gaze Guided Wheelchair System is an innovative assistive technology designed to enhance the mobility and independence of individuals with severe physical disabilities. By integrating Arduino and image processing techniques, this system allows users to control a wheelchair using their eye movements, providing a reliable and intuitive means of navigation. The core component of the system is an eye gaze tracking device that employs image processing algorithms to precisely capture and interpret the user's eye movements. This technology utilizes laptop webcam to track the position of the user's eyes, allowing for accurate detection of 
their gaze direction. The captured data is then transmitted to an Arduino microcontroller, which processes the information and translates it into wheelchair movement commands.It will demonstrate the potential of controlling the wheelchair using just their eyes. The prototype developed also has a bluetooth feature incorporated into it so that any patient attender can easily move the wheelchair by using bluetooth control.
The project will involve the development of a system that can recognize and translate eye movements into inputs to the system. The eye-gaze controlled wheelchair project aims to provide a solution for people with severe physical disabilities who could be partially paralyzed or completely paralyzed.A picture of the prototype developed is attached below.
